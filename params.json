{"name":"Mimeograph","body":"## Description\r\nmimeograph is a simple CoffeeScript library to extract text and create searchable pdf files, OCRing where necessary.  Each\r\nindividual step in the process is a separate coffee-resque job allowing for interesting scaling options.\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\n\r\n- poppler-utils (pdftotext)\r\n- libtiff\r\n- Leptonica\r\n- tesseract v3.01 (svn trunk)\r\n- ImageMagick\r\n\r\n## Install Development (OS X)\r\nInstallation is a three step process:\r\n\r\n1. install node\r\n1. install mimeograph dependencies\r\n1. install mimeograph\r\n\r\n### Node\r\nMimeograph is currently tested with Node v0.4.8.\r\n\r\n1. Download [node v0.4.8](http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.8.tar.gz).\r\n1. Untar/unzip the contents and CD into the root directory (node-v0.4.8).\r\n1. Review the installation instructions found in README.md\r\n1. run \"./configure\"\r\n1. run \"make\"\r\n1. run \"make install\"\r\n1. run \"node -v\" to verify the installation has been successful.\r\n\r\n### Mimeo Dependencies\r\nThis assumes that you have Homebrew installed and are using it for pacakge management on OS X.  If you aren't already using it download it [here](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).  If you are already using Macport or Fink and are happy with them, just use these instructions as a guide.\r\n\r\n1. run \"brew update\"\r\n1. run \"brew install poppler ghostscript imagemagick leptonica redis\"\r\n1. run \"brew info tesseract\".  At the current time the Homebrew recipe for tesseract was for v3.00 of tesseract.  If the command you ran does not indicate >= v3.01 you will have to jump through some additional hoops.\r\n    1. if Homebrew has a package for tesseract >= 3.01 run: \"brew install tesseract\"\r\n    1. if Homebrew doesn't have a package for tesseract >= 3.01 run \"brew edit tesseract\" and update the contents of the tesseract.rb with [this](https://github.com/rwst/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/tesseract.rb).\r\n\r\n### Mimeograph\r\n1. run \"git clone git@github.com:morologous/mimeograph.git\"\r\n1. run \"cd mimeograph\"\r\n1. run \"make\"\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\n\tUsage:\r\n\t  mimeograph [OPTIONS] [ID] filename\r\n\r\n\t  -h, --help         Displays options\r\n\t  -v, --version      Shows certain's version.\r\n\t  -w, --workers      Number of workers to create. (Default: 5)\r\n\t  -s, --start        Starts a Mimeograph daemon.\r\n\t  -p, --process      Kicks of the processing of a new file.\r\n\t      --port         Redis port. (Default: Redis' default)\r\n\t      --host         Redis host. (Default: Redis' default)\r\n\r\n\tv1.0.0\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\teg.  mimeograph -p test/test.pdf\r\n\t     mimeograph -w 10 -s\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Sean McDaniel\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
